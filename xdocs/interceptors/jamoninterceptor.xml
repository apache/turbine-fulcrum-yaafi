    <section name="Overview">
      <p> This service uses <a href="http://jamonapi.sourceforge.net/">JAMon</a> to capture statistical performance
        data. This performance data can be exported as HTML report into the file system or viewed using a browser when
        your application runs in a servlet container. </p>
      <p> Have a look at an a <a href="http://jamonapi.sourceforge.net/JAMonAdmin.html"> HTML example report</a>
        available from the JAMon homepage. </p>
      <p> The implementation uses reflection to invoke the JAMon library to avoid compile-time coupling. If the
        interceptor is enabled while the JAMON library is not found in the classpath the implementation silently ignores
        all intercepted calls. </p>
      <p> The service is by default disabled since the JAMon library are currently not hosted on IBIBLIO</p>
