    <section name="Service Lifecycle">

      <p>
        The service lifecycle contains of a bunch of interfaces covering the following aspects of a service

        <ul>
            <li><a href="incarnation.html">incarnation</a></li>
            <li><a href="reconfiguration.html">reconfiguration</a></li>
            <li><a href="decommission.html">decommissioning</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        These interfaces are the contract between your service implementation
        and the service container. And this is the reason why we can deploy
        a service implementation using different service framework implementations
        such as  Excalibur or Merlin.
