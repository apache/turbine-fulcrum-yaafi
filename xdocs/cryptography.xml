      <p>
        The YAAFI container supports decryption of configuration files using
        Sun's JCA (Java Crypto Architecture) and JCE (Java Crypto Extension).
      </p>

      <subsection name="JDK 1.3.x">
        <p>
          For JDK 1.3.x the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jce/index-122.html">
          Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) 1.2.2</a> needs to be installed.
          Furthermore you need to add the jce1_2_2.jar to your Maven repository
          and project.xml
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="JDK 1.4.2">
        <p>
          The current JDK's have the JCA built-in therefore no extra configuration
          is required. In the case of an older JDK you need to upgrade.
        </p>
