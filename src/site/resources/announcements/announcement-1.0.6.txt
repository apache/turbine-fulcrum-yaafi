The fulcrum-yaafi-team is pleased to announce the fulcrum-yaafi-1.0.6-SNAPSHOT.jar release!

A light-weight Avalon container

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o Added support of "fallback service mamagers" to transparently lookup
service not managed by the Avalon container instance. A good example
is the integration of Spring services or remote services hidden behind
some SOAP proxies. 
o Addded M2 build 

Fixed Bugs:
o Setting custom JAMon ranges for every invocation because those ranges
are discarded when resetting JAMon through the GUI. 

Changes:
o Moved the code regarding transparent decryption of configuration files
into 'fuclrum-yaafi-crypto' project and decouple the code using
dynamic class loading and reflection. 


Have fun!
