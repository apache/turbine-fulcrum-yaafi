o Updated CLI to make it fit for one of our products 
o Removed CVS tags since it makes maintainance difficult 
o Removed obsolete email address 
o Fixed wrong default values for parameters file if no value was defined. 
o Fixed bug in ServiceManagerService - the static field was not reset during 
  a dispose() leading to a NPE in the second invocation.

  shorthand instead of the class name
