    <section name="The Component Configuration File">

      <p>
        The component configuration file is a XML file containing configuration
        information for the instantiated Avalone services.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Adding the Avalon SystemProperty Service">
        <p>
          For finding the right section of the component configuration file
          the shorthand of the role configuration is used - in our case
          "SystemPropertyService". Here we define a system property with the
          name "FOO" and the value "BAR".
          <source><![CDATA[

<componentConfig>
  <SystemPropertyService>
    <property name="FOO">BAR</property>
  </SystemPropertyService>
</componentConfig>
          ]]></source>
        </p>
