    <section name="Lifecycle Contract">

      <p>
        The following contract is fulfilled by the Avalon YAAFI Container
      </p>

      <subsection name="Early Initialization">
        <p>
          If a service component is defined as "early-init" the instance
          of the service component will be incarnated during startup of the
          container.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Lazy Initialization">
        <p>
          If a service component is initialized lazily the
          implementation class is loaded but incarnation takes
          place during the first invocation of ServiceManager.lookup().
        </p>
        <p>
          An invocation of ServiceManager.hasService() will not incarnate
          a service component instance.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Decommisioning">
        <p>
          The decommisioning of a service component instance result
          in exactly the same state as using a lazily initialized service
          component. I.e. the implementation class is loaded but no
          instance exists
        </p>
